# Ubik
Path-tracer using embree / SDL / OpenEXR

# Examples

These examples are using a dummy integrator that opens a TIFF file from disk and "render" it.
Each time a pixel of the image is sampled, a random noise is added to the RGB value. Over time, the noise should be averaged out.

# Installation

After cloning the main repository, you need to register and update the submodules:
```bash
git submodule init thirdparty/ctpl
git submodule init thirdparty/cpp-optparse
git submodule update
```

The project is built with cmake. Cmake will try to locate the following libraries: SDL2, Tiff, OpenEXR, Embree. If it doesn't find them, you will need to specify them using the syntax shown in the example below.

```bash
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake .. \
    -DSDL2_INCLUDE_DIRS=/code/thirdparty/sdl2/2.0.9/include/SDL2/ \
    -DSDL2_LIBS=/code/thirdparty/sdl2/2.0.9/lib/gcc-6.3.0/libSDL2.so \
    -DTIFF_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/code/thirdparty/tiff/4.0.4/lib/gcc-6.3.0/libtiff.so \
    -DTIFF_INCLUDE_DIR=/code/thirdparty/tiff/4.0.4/include/ \
    -DOPENEXR_INCLUDE_DIR=/code/thirdparty/openexr/2.2.0/include/ \
    -DOPENEXR_Half_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/code/thirdparty/openexr/2.2.0/lib/gcc-6.3.0/libHalf.so \
    -DOPENEXR_IlmImf_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/code/thirdparty/openexr/2.2.0/lib/gcc-6.3.0/libIlmImf.so \
    -DEMBREE_INCLUDE_DIR=/code/thirdparty/embree/3.5.2/include \
    -DEMBREE_LIBRARY=/code/thirdparty/embree/3.5.2/lib/gcc-6.3.0/libembree.so
make
```
Once built, the executable will be located in the project's *bin* folder.
