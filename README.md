# Ubik
WIP C++ Path-tracer framework using SDL for interactivity / display.
Modular design to allow for experimentations, so it's easy to implement a new Sampler, Integrator or Renderer.

**Current status:**
* Renderer:
  * TiledRenderer (```--renderer=tiled```) provides tiled rendering with several traversal algorightms. It allows for any number of output drivers:
    * a display driver using SDL so you can see the progress of the render
    * an output driver writing out OpenEXR files
  * InteractiveRenderer (```--renderer=interactive```) provides interactive progressive rendering and allows to edit the scene using the mouse and keyboard
* Sampler:
  * FixedSampler (```--sampler=fixed```) provides fixed sampling (all pixels are evaluated the same number of times). You can specify the number of samples with ```--samples=N``` (each pixel will be sampled 2^N times)
  * AdaptativeSampler (```--sampler=adaptative```) provides adaptative sampling (pixels are sampled at least 2^*min_samples* times, up to 2^*max_samples* times or when the variation gets below *threshold*). Parameters are specified with ```--min-samples```, ```--max-samples``` and ```--threshold```.
* Integrator:
  * PathTracer (```--integrator=pathtracer```) WIP path tracing using embree
  * SmallPt (```--integrator=smallpt```) provides path tracing using the "smallpt" algorithm (see References)
  * ImageRender (```--integrator=image```) is used mainly to test the framework. It reads a TIFF file from disk and "renders" a noisy version of it, ie. each time a pixel of the image is sampled a random noise is added to the RGB value - the idea being that with enough samples the noise should be averaged out.

# Usage

Example specifying the sampler, integrator and renderer by name on the command line:
```
ubik --renderer=tiled --sampler=fixed --samples=2 --integrator=smallpt --width=640 --height=480 --show-window
```

This will produce the following render:

# Examples

These examples are using the dummy image render integrator. They will be replaced by a proper 3d path render when it's implemented.

# Installation

After cloning the main repository, you need to register and update the submodules:
```bash
git submodule init thirdparty/ctpl
git submodule init thirdparty/cpp-optparse
git submodule update
```

The project is built with cmake. Cmake will try to locate the following libraries: SDL2, Tiff, OpenEXR, Embree. If it doesn't find them, you will need to specify them using the syntax shown in the example below.

```bash
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake .. \
    -DSDL2_INCLUDE_DIRS=/code/thirdparty/sdl2/2.0.9/include/SDL2/ \
    -DSDL2_LIBS=/code/thirdparty/sdl2/2.0.9/lib/gcc-6.3.0/libSDL2.so \
    -DTIFF_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/code/thirdparty/tiff/4.0.4/lib/gcc-6.3.0/libtiff.so \
    -DTIFF_INCLUDE_DIR=/code/thirdparty/tiff/4.0.4/include/ \
    -DOPENEXR_INCLUDE_DIR=/code/thirdparty/openexr/2.2.0/include/ \
    -DOPENEXR_Half_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/code/thirdparty/openexr/2.2.0/lib/gcc-6.3.0/libHalf.so \
    -DOPENEXR_IlmImf_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/code/thirdparty/openexr/2.2.0/lib/gcc-6.3.0/libIlmImf.so \
    -DEMBREE_INCLUDE_DIR=/code/thirdparty/embree/3.5.2/include \
    -DEMBREE_LIBRARY=/code/thirdparty/embree/3.5.2/lib/gcc-6.3.0/libembree.so
make
```
Once built, the executable will be located in the project's *bin* folder.
